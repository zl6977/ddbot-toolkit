 shared ontology/examples   validation/reasoning
```

The bundled Python modules implement ontology search, example retrieval, and validation. The CLI
is their stable executable boundary; the Skill instructions own the conversational workflow and do
not duplicate that implementation.

## Interface priority

1. **Python modules** own implementations and structured result models.
2. **CLI** is the executable interface for local coding agents, people, and CI.
3. **Skill** owns the user-input, intent-sketch, draft-generation, validation, and repair workflow.
4. **Skill directory** packages the instructions and runtime as one directly installable unit.

## Runtime modes

During source development, run commands from the repository root:

```bash
uv run model-dwis-config/scripts/ddbot.py <command>
```

Because an agent normally works in the user's repository rather than the skill directory, invoke
the Skill's entry script by its resolved path:

```bash
uv run <skill-root>/scripts/ddbot.py <command>
```

Resolve the installed path from the selected `SKILL.md`; never hard-code a developer checkout path.

## Current capabilities

| Capability | Python implementation | CLI command |
|---|---|---|
| Ontology search | `OntologySearch.search` | `ontology` |
| Example retrieval | `MotifRetriever.search` | `motif` |
| Validation | `DDBotToolkit.validate` | `validate` |

## Single-source layout

`model-dwis-config/` is the skill root. Its `SKILL.md` and `references/` define the workflow;
`scripts/ddbot.py` is the sole entry point and `scripts/ddbot_toolkit/` is the only implementation.
The ontology and example corpus have one maintained copy under `assets/`, where both the agent and
CLI can find them. The repository root contains development tests, documentation, dependency
locking, and interface contracts without adding them to the installed Skill.
